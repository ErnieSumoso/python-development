<h3 align="center">Python Development Repository</h3>

  I use this repository to store my Python development notebooks.
  From programming exercises, to machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning,
  I have uploaded mostly everything including complex projects in separate files.
  The project repository is organized into folders by topic.

## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <img src="readme-files/project-showcase.jpg" alt="Showcase" width="600">
</div>
This repository was originally created to store and track my progress in developing programming skills using Python 3.
However, it quickly became a place for storing solved exercises, ranging from basic to complex, which can help others in their endeavors.
Most of the exercises were solved using JupyterLab for enhanced visualization of results and testing.
Feel free to explore the problems and my solutions!

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Getting Started

As this is a repository to store exercises, you only need basic Python and JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook installations.
Using Anaconda Navigator is recommeded.

### Prerequisites

To run the code you need to have Python installed on your computer and JupyterLab (or Notebook) for visualization and file editing.
* [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [JupyterLab 4.0+](https://jupyter.org/install) or Jupyer Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ErnieSumoso/python-exercises.git
   ```
2. Explore the files and enjoy!

## Usage

You can use this repository to solve the problems yourself, try new approaches, and improve your Python programming skills!

Here are some resources that I use for help:

- [Python 3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [101 NLP Exercises](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/nlp-exercises/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Roadmap

- [ ] Add algorithms exercises
- [ ] Add machine learning exercises
- [ ] Complete the 101 natural language processing problems

I am always open for any suggestions on what exercises to solve. Please, add them on the [issues section](https://github.com/ErnieSumoso/python-exercises/issues).
