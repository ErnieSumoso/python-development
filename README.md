<h3 align="center">Python Development Repository</h3>

  I use this repository to store most of my Python notebooks from JupyterLab. From programming exercises, to machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning exercises, I have uploaded everything and organized them into different folders for each specific topic.

## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <img src="readme-files/project-showcase.jpg" alt="Showcase" width="600">
</div>
This repository was originally created to store and track my progress in programming skills using Python 3. Please note that some of these solutions were programmed a while ago when I was starting my learning journey. Not all solutions have been optimzed and revised, though this repository is an intended way to keep my notebooks organized. All exercises were solved using JupyterLab to ease the process of visualizing results and testing. Feel free to explore the problems and my solutions.

## Getting Started

This is a basic repository to store exercises, you only need Python and JupyterLab (or Jupyter Notebook) installed on your computer. Using Anaconda Navigator is recommeded, but not required.

### Prerequisites

To run the code you need to have Python installed on your computer and JupyterLab (or Notebook) for file editing.
* [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [JupyterLab 4.0+](https://jupyter.org/install) or Jupyer Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ErnieSumoso/python-exercises.git
   ```
2. Install and open JupyterLab.
3. Explore the files and enjoy!
